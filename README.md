Description
The Product Dashboard is designed to streamline the process of managing product information. It offers a user-friendly interface for adding new products, viewing key statistics (such as total products, inventory levels, and prices), and managing product data. The dashboard connects to a MongoDB database for secure storage and retrieval of product data.

Usage
        Add a Product: Navigate to the
'Products' tab and click the 'Add a New Product' button. Fill in the product details and click 'Save'.
        View Product Statistics: The 
dashboard displays the total number of products, their total value, and inventory levels.
        Manage Products: From the 'Products'
tab, you can view all products, update details, or remove them from the database.


Future Enhancements
        User Authentication: Add role-base
access control for different admin levels.
        Analytics: Include more
detailed product analytics, such as sales tracking and inventory forecasting.
        Export Data: Add the ability to 
export product data to CSV or Excel formats.
